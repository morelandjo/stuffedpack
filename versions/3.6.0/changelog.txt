I have been slacking again, finally found time to update the modpack. This is a significant update with breaking changes. At some point a modpack this size becomes too big and bloated. It was taking far too long for worlds to be created. I have removed several mods that were causing performance issues. The game should load in about 2 minutes and worlds should load in 1-2.

New:
Light Detector
Aquatic Torches Returns
Windows Keyboard Fixes Returns
Jagm's Kiwis

Removed:
Better FPS
AI Improvements
Better Biome Reblend
Flerovium
Fix GPU Memory Leak
Achievements Optimizer
In Control
Immersive Optimization
Cull Leaves
Structure Essentials
Day Display
Clickable Advancements
Global Packs
