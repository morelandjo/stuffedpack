GAME BREAKING REVISION

Please read if you are updating thisa pack from a previous version.

As part of this update we've removed immersive portals. The mod compatability list along with the general instability of the mod in the pack has caused us to remove it. If you want to keep playing your old world here are your options:

1. Remove all portals from your world, then update.

2. Download the update then download immersive portals sepatrately and add it to the pack.

3. Play a new world.


Major update!
This update adds numerous mods, features, and fixes so I have labeled this version 2.0.0! 

Notable changes:
- I've added a new dark mode GUI that I created myself. I prefer dark mode in my mods and didn't like all of the options other offered. You can disable this in resource packs if you don't like it.

- New loading screen!
